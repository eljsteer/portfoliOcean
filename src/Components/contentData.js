    Description: 
    `I was born and raised in the countryside just outside of Christchurch, NZ.
    In July 2018 I shifted over to Sydney for warmer weather and greatly improved career opportunities.
    A career change into Software & Web development is a priority for me at the moment.
    I am primarily wanting a change from my current role as an Accountant to the world of Tech, 
    along with oppportunities to level-up my creative problem-solving skills and explore the complexities of blockchain technology.
    My long term dream is to eventually work into a role as a blockchain or DApp developer`,
