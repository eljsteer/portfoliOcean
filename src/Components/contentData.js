    `Hi, I am a full stack Web Developer, with a background in finance and accounting.  
    
    I recently completed a certificate in Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp from the University of Sydney.
    The bootcamp gave me a solid proficiency with skills centred around the MERN stack. 
    Completing the bootcamp was also the first step taken towards my long term aspirations to eventually work in Web3 as a blockchain or DApp developer.
    In my lifelong learning journey, I am always looking for new opportunities to learn, challenge myself and collobrate on projects, so please don't hesitate to get in touch about anything.

    Enjoy browsing my Portfolio.
