    Name: "Jason Steer",
    Description: 
    `I was born and raised in just outside of Christchurch, NZ. 
    In July 2018 I shifted over to Sydney for warmer weather and greatly improved career opportunities.
    I am seeking a career change into Software & Web development from my current role as an Accountant. 
    The problem-solving within accounting strikes a chord with me. 
    I am wanting to develop this further with Software development, while concurrently looking for further challenges.
    My long term dream is to eventually work into a role as a blockchain or DApp developer as in the couple of years I have developed a keen interest in cryptocurrencies, blockchain and the technology behind these developments`,
